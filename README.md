## Project Description
This project demonstrates my knowledge of game design and development using Unity in C#. 
The game, "Brick Buster," involves a player being able to use their mouse to move a bar that can collide with the ball. 
The ball uses physics mechanics to hit the blocks, which adds to the player's score. The player is given 3 lives and 3 levels to complete.
   
## Game Features 
- Mouse Movement: Allows the player to move the bar to hit the ball using mouse/mouse pad movements.
- Lives: Gives the player 3 lives before they lose.
- Score: Adds 10 points to the player's score for each brick they hit.
- Levels: Gives the player 3 levels to complete before finishing the game.
